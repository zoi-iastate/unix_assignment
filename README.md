Project started 2025-02-16
\n 2025-02-17: Used 'grep' to create teosinite and maize genotype files in accordance with the selected groups. \n Also sorted and removed unnecessary columns from the snp_position.txt
Also just found out that \n does not work in .md files so ignore that please :)
2025/02/19: Sorted both the maize data base and teosinte datbase by increasing and decreasing positions. Used sed to encode teosinte with '?'. Also used awk to properly search for chr1 using the built in arguments. Will create all the files sometime this week.
