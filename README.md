Project started in UNIX in 2025-02-16

2025-02-17: Used 'grep' to create teosinite and maize genotype files in accordance with the selected groups. Also sorted and removed unnecessary columns from the snp_position.txt. Then joined the snps file and genotype files together after sorting.

2025/02/19: Sorted both the maize data base and teosinte datbase by increasing and decreasing positions using sorts ability to select multiple columns. Used sed to encode teosinte with '?'. Also used awk to properly search for chr1 using the built in arguments. Will create all the files sometime this week.

2025/02/21: Added all files to GitHub and created a public key. Finsihed creating increasing/decreasing encoded position files for both maize and teosinte. Also created seperate files for data in multiple chromosomes and with the label 'unique' with the use of awk (for all files).

Also to note, I did have other commit messages but did not setup the public repository right away so those were lost. This file should provide clarity for the process I used.
