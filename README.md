Project started 2025-02-16

2025-02-17: Used 'grep' to create teosinite and maize genotype files in accordance with the selected groups. Also sorted and removed unnecessary columns from the snp_position.txt. Then joined the snps file and genotype files together after sorting.

2025/02/19: Sorted both the maize data base and teosinte datbase by increasing and decreasing positions. Used sed to encode teosinte with '?'. Also used awk to properly search for chr1 using the built in arguments. Will create all the files sometime this week.

2025/02/21: Added all files to GitHub and created a public key. Finsihed creating increasing/decreasing encoded position files for both maize and teosinte. Also created seperate files for data in multiple chromosomes and with the label 'unique'.
